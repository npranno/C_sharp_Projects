# C_sharp_Projects
This is a Repository of my Basic C# project while studying at The Tech Academy

In it you will find a working Car Insurance App, that calculates to see if the user qualifies for car insurance.
In this app, it will also calculate the quote (if the user does in fact qualify), based on the information entered.

You will also find a working console application of the popular gambling game called Black Jack.

There are also many other small apps and exercises displaying the basic functions of C#

Enjoy!
