# C# Projects
This is a repository of my Basic C# and .NET Framework projects while studying at The Tech Academy

These are two of my projects during the C# Course:

#Car Insurance app:

This is an MVC web application to replicate a car insurance website. The user inputs their information, and a quote is calculated based on business logic. Additionally, it includes an admin page to view the quotes issued and the user information.

You can view the Car Insurance App here:

#Twenty One Game (Black Jack):

This is a basic console app utilizng .NET Framework to create a Twenty One card game. It includes methods to generate a dealer, deck, and shuffled cards. Logic is used to create the basic rules of Twenty One.

There are also many other small apps and exercises displaying the basic functions of C# and the .NET Framework.

Enjoy!
